            At Genesys, you'll be exposed to every discipline in our creative<br/> 
            process – UX, UI, interaction design, and copywriting. You’ll be<br/> 
            part of a dynamic team that's made up of like-minded, talented<br/> 
            people. You'll work hard with them to create things that will<br/> 
            amaze everyone everywhere.

            winning pitches, preparing assets, and design scriptures for<br/> 
            productions, you'll be in the thick of it all.
