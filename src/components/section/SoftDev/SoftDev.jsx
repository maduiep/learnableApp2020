            Creativity means a lot to us. So we look for people who can think<br/> 
            both logistically and artistically, and who know that limits are<br/> 
            made to be pushed. We value skill and aptitude, but we honor<br/> 
            those who care about working with their team to add the<br/>
             Genesys flavour to every project. 
            <br/><br/>
            As a developer, being part of the team exposes you to a range of<br/>
            diverse, like-minded talented people who are sure to make the<br/> 
            experience fun for you. You’ll get a shot at building amazing<br/> 
            things, developing yourself, learning on the job, while<br/>
            exchanging healthy jokes and having random hangouts once in a<br/>
            while.

              Play nice with other people.
              <br/><br/>
              Be an actively engaging person. That means you are present, <br/>
              motivated, and social. You know how to communicate effectively<br/> 
              with your teammates.

              Love to code. You understand the basics of programming and<br/> 
              object-oriented design and development.
              <br/><br/>
              Have an eye for detail. Your keen observation helps you catch<br/> 
              discrepancies and fix them quickly.

              Be innately curious. Your love for technology is insatiable,<br/>
              so you’re always researching and experimenting. Learning new<br/> 
              technical skills while on the job is something you look forward to.

              Appreciate good design. You want to make something that<br/> 
              doesn't just work flawlessly but looks amazing.
