            Before you’re done with Learnable, you will apply everything you’ve <br/>
            learned. You’ll be part of a team made up of 2 designers and 4 <br/>
            developers. You’ll get to work alongside the Genesys team on <br/>
            projects and we’ll teach you how “the sauce” is made. By combining <br/>
            technology, design, and great ideas, your team will have the unique <br/>
            opportunity to collaborate with the Genesys team to bring your own <br/>
            concept to life, from the first pen sketches to the final functioning <br/>
            product. You’ll then get to show off your special project to everyone.
