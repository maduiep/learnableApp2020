      Before you’re done with Learnable, you will apply everything <br/> 
      you’ve learned. You’ll be part of a team made up of 2 designers<br/>
      and 4 developers. You’ll get to work alongside the Genesys team<br/> 
      on projects and we’ll teach you how “the sauce” is made. By<br/> 
      combining technology, design, and great ideas, your team will<br/> 
      have the unique opportunity to collaborate with the Genesys<br/> 
      team to bring your own concept to life, from the first pen<br/> 
      sketches to the final functioning product. You’ll then get to show<br/> 
      off your special project to everyone.
